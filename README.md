## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

In this project, I will be using the Airbnb Seattle data as an example to answer some of the important business questions that might help you better lead your new Airbnb venture and hopefully give clarity on what kind of thought process is required to ask the correct business questions. Bar, scatter, and choropleth plots are used to facilitate our understanding and help us notice some patterns which answer our business questions.

## Buisness questions answered<a name="questions"></a>

1. What is the best month to visit Seattle if you are on a budget?
2. What is the best time to list your property on Airbnb? And how do set price rates according to the time of the year?
3. What is the best time in the year when owners can take down their listing for maintenance and repair?
4. What patterns observed from the data might help increase the business of Airbnb owners?
